#The `knapsack_greedy` function takes three inputs: `values`, `weights`, and `capacity`. These represent the values, weights, and maximum capacity of the knapsack, respectively. 

#First, the function calculates the length of the `values` list (which should be the same as the length of the `weights` list), and creates a list of all the items in the knapsack, called `items`.

#Next, the function calculates the value-to-weight ratio for each item and stores them in a list called `ratios`. The value-to-weight ratio is simply the value of the item divided by its weight. 

#After that, the `ratios_sorted` list is created by sorting the `items` list in descending order based on their corresponding value-to-weight ratio. This is where the greedy aspect of the algorithm comes into play - we want to choose items that have the highest value-to-weight ratio first, because those items will provide the most value for their weight.

#The function then initializes variables `max_value` and `knapsack` to 0 and an empty list, respectively. These variables will keep track of the maximum value that can be stolen using the greedy algorithm and the items in the knapsack.

#Finally, the function loops through the items in `ratios_sorted`, adding each item to the knapsack (and updating `max_value` and `capacity` accordingly) if the item can fit in the remaining capacity of the knapsack.

#The function returns `max_value`, which is the maximum value that can be stolen using the greedy algorithm given the input values and constraints.

#In the main code, the `values`, `weights`, and `capacity` variables are defined, and the `knapsack_greedy` function is called with these inputs. The resulting `max_value` is printed to the console.
